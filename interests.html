        <h2>interests and Hobbies</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>All things cardboard and crafts!
                <p>I personally believe there is nothing you can't accomplish with a bit of glue, corrigated sheetpaper, and creativity.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><a href="https://www.boxwars.com/" target="_blank"><img src="box_wars.jpeg" alt="Boxwars logo" width="200"></a></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>

            <li>Laserdisc players and other vintage tech
                <p>Endless facination with older tech and their history. They just don't make them like they used to.</p>

            </li>

            <li>Indie games
                <p>As a lifelong superfan of all games and an aspiring game-maker, nothing inspires me more than other creative projects</p>

            </li>

            <li>Drawing and sketching
                <p>My number one hobby and talent. You'll often find me doodling in the margins of all my notes!</p>

            </li>

            <li>Animation
                <p>No movies have captivated me in the same way the picture's like studio Ghibli's can.</p>
                <img src="spirit.jpeg" alt="Movie cover for Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away" width="200">
