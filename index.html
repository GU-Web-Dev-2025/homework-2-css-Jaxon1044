                Hello Internet! My name is Jaxon. Lemmie tell you a bit more about myself:

                Growing up, I've been an avid fan in all things art, comprized in endless
                hours of doodling in sketchbooks to making full-on videogames. Along the way
                I've picked up plenty of skills for coding, designing interfaces,
                managing group projects, and other talents that will make me an invaluble
                asset to your team.
            </p>
