                Hello Internet! My name is Jaxon. Lemmie tell you a bit more about myself:

                Growing up, I've been an avid fan in all things art, comprized in endless

                I've picked up plenty of skills for coding, designing interfaces,
                managing group projects, and other talents that will make me an invaluble
                asset to your team.
            </p>
